Caesar Cipher
This is a basic implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in Python.

Description
A Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This program allows users to encode or decode messages by shifting letters based on a user-provided shift number.

Features
Encode (encrypt) and decode (decrypt) messages.

Maintains non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, numbers, punctuation).

Loop functionality for multiple encryptions or decryptions.

Wraps around the alphabet for letters near the end.
