# ðŸ“¬ Mail Merge Project â€“ Day 24 of #100DaysOfCode

This is a simple **Mail Merge** automation project built with Python. It reads a list of names from a text file, inserts each name into a letter template, and generates personalized invitation letters.

## ðŸ›  What It Does

âœ… Reads names from a file  
âœ… Replaces a placeholder (`[name]`) in a letter template  
âœ… Writes a personalized letter for each person into the `Output/ReadyToSend` folder
