ðŸ•’ Pomodoro Timer â€“ Tkinter Python App
This is a simple Pomodoro Timer built using Pythonâ€™s tkinter library. It follows the Pomodoro Technique â€” a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… Start and Reset buttons
âœ… Countdown display with a tomato-themed interface
âœ… Tracks work sessions and adds a checkmark (ðŸ—¸) for each completed session
âœ… Visual distinction between Work, Short Break, and Long Break sessions
âœ… Fully implemented in Python using tkinter
âœ… Customizable durations for work and break sessions

ðŸ§± How It Works
1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th: Work Sessions (default 25 min or set to 1 min for testing)

2nd, 4th, 6th: Short Breaks (default 5 min)

8th: Long Break (default 20 min)

Every time the timer finishes, it automatically starts the next session based on the cycle. A checkmark ðŸ—¸ is added after each work session is completed.
