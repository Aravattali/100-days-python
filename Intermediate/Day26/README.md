# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter 🔤➡️🎙️

This Python script takes a word as user input and converts each letter into its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet code word using data from a CSV file.

## 📁 Files

- `nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv`: Contains the mapping of letters to NATO code words.
- `main.py`: The script that reads the CSV and performs the word-to-code conversion.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Reading CSV files using `pandas`
- Creating dictionaries using dictionary comprehension
- Iterating through user input to map letters to phonetic code words
- Handling uppercase conversion and list comprehension

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Ensure `pandas` is installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
